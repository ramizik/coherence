    "coachingAdvice": "The presentation demonstrated consistently composed body language and generally good eye contact, establishing a professional and engaging presence. These strengths provide a solid base for further development.\n\nWhile these foundational elements were strong, the overall impact suggests specific areas needing focused attention. Key improvements include minimizing frequent filler words, which significantly impacted the clarity and professionalism of the message. Additionally, refining the speaking pace to be more energetic will elevate engagement, and consistently maintaining eye contact throughout the delivery will further strengthen audience connection.\n\nTo effectively address these points, practice the 'triangle technique' to cultivate a natural and consistent eye gaze. Concurrently, implement the 'pause and breathe' exercise, strategically replacing filler words with powerful moments of silence to enhance overall delivery.",
