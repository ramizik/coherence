    "coachingAdvice": "The presentation demonstrated a well-paced delivery, minimal use of filler words, and consistently composed body language. The speaker also maintained generally good eye contact throughout.\n\nWhile generally effective, eye contact requires more consistent application across the entire presentation. A significant area for development was the observable disconnect between verbal expression and facial cues, particularly when conveying enthusiasm with an anxious expression. Furthermore, opportunities were missed to visually reinforce key points, such as referring to data without a corresponding on-screen gesture.\n\nTo enhance engagement and consistency, practice the 'triangle technique' by varying your gaze between the camera and points to its left and right. Additionally, rehearse in front of a mirror, consciously matching your facial expressions to the emotional content of your words to ensure authentic delivery.",
